# What is this? (problem)

CityHop is a node app for travelers on the go. When you want or need to plan a trip in a short amount of time, you can use CityHop to check the weather, look for events, and build an itinerary.  Through the magic of Express, MySQL, Sequelize APIs, this app allows travelers to view the weather conditions in five cities (Atlanta, Amsterdam, Dubai, Johannesburg, Miami, Paris, Tokyo), virtually build an itinerary in those cities, and get the latest social media buzz on those cities.

Additionally, we've added some styling (materialize and bootstrap) to make it visually appealing and easy to navigate. We have included some snap shots of our visually appeabelow, but, to get the full effect, you should hop through the app.
